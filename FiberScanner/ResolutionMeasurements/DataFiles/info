Axial.mat contains the measured reflected intensity (V) on a photodetector (PDA36A2) as a reflective resolution card (reflective portion only) was passed through the beam focus for V3.3 versus position measured in millimeters.
Lateral.mat contains the measured reflected intensity (V) on a photodetector versus position (mm) as the reflective edge of the card was passed laterally through the beam focus for V3.3.
